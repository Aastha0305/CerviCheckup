## Introduction
Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer. The highest rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality are in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), Central America, and South-East Asia. In contrast, it is the second most frequent cancer among women in India. It is a clinically staged disease that could be treated with early detection and intervention, reducing mortality and improving patient outcomes.I have tried to evaluate the performances of different machine-learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic regression, random forest, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), decision tree, and Adaboost for predicting cervical cancer. 

## Features
- Predicts the likelihood of cervical cancer based on medical data
- Utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms
- Provides interpretable results for medical professionals

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Aniyamodi/cervical-cancer-prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd cervical-cancer-prediction
    ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
